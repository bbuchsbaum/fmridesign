\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more variable names (bare or character) or expressions involving variables
present in the \code{data} argument of \code{event_model}.}

\item{basis}{the impulse response function or the name of a pre-supplied function,
one of: "gamma", "spmg1", "spmg2", "spmg3", "bspline", "gaussian", "tent", "bs".
Can also be an \code{HRF} object.}

\item{hrf_fun}{optional per-onset HRF generator. Can be:
\itemize{
\item A function that takes a data frame of event data (with columns \code{onset}, \code{duration},
\code{blockid}, plus any term variables) and returns either a single HRF object
(recycled to all events) or a list of HRF objects (one per event).
\item A formula (e.g., \code{~hrf_column}) referencing a column in the event data that
contains a list of pre-built HRF objects.
}
When \code{hrf_fun} is specified, the \code{basis} argument is ignored. The generator function
is called AFTER any subsetting via \verb{subset=}, ensuring correct alignment between
HRFs and events. All returned HRFs must have the same \code{nbasis} for design matrix consistency.}

\item{onsets}{optional onsets override. If missing, onsets will be taken from the LHS of the main model formula.}

\item{durations}{optional durations override. If missing, durations argument from \code{event_model} is used.}

\item{prefix}{a character string that is prepended to the variable names and used to identify the term.
Can be used to disambiguate two \code{hrf} terms with the same variable(s) but different onsets or basis functions.}

\item{subset}{an expression indicating the subset of 'onsets' to keep.}

\item{precision}{sampling precision in seconds.}

\item{nbasis}{number of basis functions -- only used for hemodynamic response functions (e.g. bspline) that take a variable number of bases.}

\item{contrasts}{one or more \code{contrast_spec} objects created with the \code{contrast}, \code{pair_contrast} etc. functions.
Must be NULL, a single contrast spec, or a \emph{named} list of contrast specs.}

\item{id}{a unique \code{character} identifier used to refer to term, otherwise will be determined from variable names.}

\item{name}{Optional human-readable name for the term.}

\item{lag}{a temporal offset in seconds which is added to onset before convolution}

\item{summate}{whether impulse amplitudes sum up when duration is greater than 0.}

\item{normalize}{logical; if TRUE, each convolved regressor column is peak-normalized
so that \code{max(abs(column)) == 1}. This is useful when events have different durations,
since longer events produce taller peaks after convolution. Normalizing ensures that
beta estimates reflect condition differences rather than duration-dependent amplitude
scaling, which is important for analyses like MVPA or RSA. Default FALSE.}

\description{
This function is to be used in formulas for fitting functions, e.g. onsets ~ hrf(fac1,fac2) ...
It captures the variables/expressions provided and packages them with HRF/contrast
information into an \code{hrfspec} object, which is then processed by \code{event_model}.
}
\examples{

## 'hrf' is typically used in the context of \code{formula}s passed to `event_model`.

# Simple model with one factor
form1 <- onsets ~ hrf(condition, basis="spmg1")

# Model with factor and continuous modulator, using default SPMG1 for both terms
form2 <- onsets ~ hrf(condition) + hrf(RT)

# Model with interaction term and SPMG3 basis
form3 <- onsets ~ hrf(condition, RT, basis="spmg3")

# Model with an expression and contrasts
library(rlang)
con1 <- pair_contrast(~ condition == "A", ~ condition == "B", name="AvB")
form4 <- onsets ~ hrf(condition, Poly(RT, 2), contrasts=con1)

# Per-onset HRF using hrf_fun: variable duration boxcars
form5 <- onsets ~ hrf(condition,
                      hrf_fun = function(d) {
                        lapply(d$duration, function(dur) fmrihrf::hrf_boxcar(width = dur))
                      })

# Per-onset HRF using hrf_fun with weighted HRFs for events with internal structure
# (e.g., clusters of weighted impulses)
form6 <- onsets ~ hrf(condition,
                      hrf_fun = function(d) {
                        Map(function(times, weights, onset) {
                          fmrihrf::hrf_weighted(times = times - onset, weights = weights)
                        }, d$sub_times, d$sub_weights, d$onset)
                      })
