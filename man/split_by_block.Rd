\examples{
# Create sample event data across multiple blocks
events <- data.frame(
  onset = c(2, 6, 10, 24, 28, 32),
  condition = factor(c("A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "B")),
  rt = c(0.5, 0.8, 0.6, 0.9, 0.7, 0.4),
  block = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2)
)

# Create sampling frame with 2 blocks
sf <- fmrihrf::sampling_frame(blocklens = c(15, 15), TR = 2)

# Create event model
model <- event_model(
  onset ~ hrf(condition) + hrf(rt),
  data = events,
  block = ~block,
  sampling_frame = sf
)

# Split design matrix by block
split_dm <- split_by_block(model)
length(split_dm)  # Should be 2 (number of blocks)
lapply(split_dm, dim)  # Dimensions for each block
