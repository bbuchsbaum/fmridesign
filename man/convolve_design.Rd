\title{Convolve HRF with Design Matrix.}
\usage{
convolve_design(hrf, dmat, globons, durations, summate = TRUE, hrf_list = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{hrf}{A function representing the HRF (used when hrf_list is NULL).}

\item{dmat}{Design matrix (with named columns).}

\item{globons}{Numeric vector of global onsets.}

\item{durations}{Numeric vector of event durations.}

\item{summate}{Logical; if TRUE, summate the convolved HRF (default: TRUE).}

\item{hrf_list}{Optional list of HRF objects, one per event (row in dmat).
When provided, allows per-onset HRF specification. The list is subsetted
to match non-zero amplitude events for each condition.}
}
\value{
A list of regressors (one for each column).
}
\description{
Convolves a HRF with a design matrix (one column per condition) to produce a
list of regressors.
}
\examples{
hrf <- fmrihrf::HRF_SPMG1
dmat <- data.frame(A = c(1, 0, 1), B = c(0, 1, 0))
globons <- c(0, 10, 20)
durations <- rep(0, 3)
regs <- convolve_design(hrf, dmat, globons, durations)
length(regs)
